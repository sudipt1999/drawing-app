# Web Based Drawing App

This is a web based drawing application that uses **`HTML`**, **`CSS`** and **`JavaScript`** to allow you to draw anything you like on the web!

To run it, simply [click here](https://sudipt1999.github.io/drawing-app/) to start drawing. 

To draw, simply place the cursor anywhere on the canvas, hold either right or left click on the mouse, and drag the cursor. 

Whenever you're finished with the current drawing, you can choose to either save or clear it. These options can be found under the main canvas -- simply click on Clear to delete the picture, or Save to save the picture (it will be shown at the bottom). Note that the save functionality can only save the most recent drawing; if you choose to save another picture, it will overwrite the previous drawing.

## How does it work?
The application utilizes **`HTML`**, **`CSS`** and **`JavaScript`** in different ways.
* **`HTML`** is used to initize the app by calling the **`scipt.js`** and **`style.css`** functions. The clear and save buttons are also set up here as well. 
* **`CSS`** is used to set canvas and startup popup styles (i.e. window size/positioning, font, buttons) -- how they visually look. 
* **`JavaScript`** is used to establish the app functionality (drawing, clearing/saving the picture, and the startup popup)
